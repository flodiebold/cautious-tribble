** TODO improve error handling
 - report errors in yaml parsing etc. on the deployable status
** TODO when a deployment fails with 400 or similar, cache that and don't try again until it changes
 - that means more state though... maybe just rely on validation
 - maybe do exponential backoff for 400s
** TODO integration-test configmap & secret deployment
** TODO reload config on every loop
** TODO fix signal handling
use https://docs.rs/signal-hook/0.1.0/signal_hook/
** TODO add dry run mode (default for CLI)
** TODO add full diff mode that compares all resources with what would be deployed
 - in CLI mode, show diffs using treediff crate
 - fall back automatically to this for resources that don't have an annotation
 - don't deploy if the diff contains nothing

 - json output with -o json
 - table otherwise
 - expect only one env by default, all envs with option
 - show commit message of the deployed / to deploy commit for each resource

** TODO use k8s api instead of relying on kubectl for deployment
** TODO allow complete deployment stop for an env (i.e. disabling a deployer)
 - although that becomes a problem when you have something you really want deployed anyway
 - in that case you could maybe deploy it via command-line
** TODO validate yamls before deploying
 - allow disabling validation by yaml
 - detect k8s version automatically?
 - maybe https://gitlab.com/silwol/juster
** TODO validate & report validation status for envs that aren't actually deployed (i.e. 'latest')
 - handle as 'just validation' Deployer?

*** deployer + transitioner
**** when I change a service in available, it first gets deployed to dev. Then, when the deployment was successful, it gets deployed to pp
**** when a deployment to dev is not successful, it is not mirrored to pp

* alternatives for version file merge method

*** version file e.g.:
version: 123abc
*** base file:
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
...
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: service
        image: exampleservice:$version
** json pointer:
*** version file e.g.:
"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/image": "exampleservice:123abc"
*** base file does not contain image at all
** json pointer + container references:
*** version file e.g.:
containers:
