   CLOSED: [2018-08-04 Sa 20:45]
** TODO improve error handling
 - report errors in yaml parsing etc. on the deployable status
** TODO when a deployment fails with 400 or similar, cache that and don't try again until it changes
 - that means more state though... maybe just rely on validation
 - maybe do exponential backoff for 400s
** TODO integration-test configmap & secret deployment
** TODO reload config on every loop
** TODO fix signal handling
use https://docs.rs/signal-hook/0.1.0/signal_hook/
** Maybe now
*** TODO better version file merging
*** TODO validate yamls before deploying
  - allow disabling validation by yaml
  - detect k8s version automatically?
  - maybe https://gitlab.com/silwol/juster
** Later
*** TODO add dry run mode (default for CLI)
*** TODO add full diff mode that compares all resources with what would be deployed
  - in CLI mode, show diffs using treediff crate
  - fall back automatically to this for resources that don't have an annotation
  - don't deploy if the diff contains nothing
*** TODO cli: add nicer output
  - json output with -o json
  - table otherwise
  - expect only one env by default, all envs with option
  - show commit message of the deployed / to deploy commit for each resource
*** TODO allow reading from file system instead of git in CLI mode
*** TODO check rollout status of configmap to all nodes
  - somehow?
*** TODO support deploying daemonsets
  - restart pods?
*** TODO support deploying ingresses
*** TODO support deploying cron jobs

*** TODO roll deployments when configmaps change?
*** TODO just use blob OIDs instead of earliest commit?
*** TODO handle undeploying something
 is that a use case though?
*** TODO do resource patching without kubectl?
  - makes diffs more reliable
  - API support in https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/555

*** TODO use k8s api instead of relying on kubectl for deployment
*** TODO allow complete deployment stop for an env (i.e. disabling a deployer)
  - although that becomes a problem when you have something you really want deployed anyway
  - in that case you could maybe deploy it via command-line
*** TODO validate & report validation status for envs that aren't actually deployed (i.e. 'latest')
  - handle as 'just validation' Deployer?
