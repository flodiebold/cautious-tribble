** TODO improve error handling
 - report errors in yaml parsing etc. on the deployable status
** TODO when a deployment fails with 400 or similar, cache that and don't try again until it changes
 - that means more state though... maybe just rely on validation
** TODO integration-test configmap & secret deployment
** TODO reload config on every loop
** TODO fix signal handling
use https://docs.rs/signal-hook/0.1.0/signal_hook/
** TODO add dry run mode (default for CLI)

 - in CLI mode, show diffs using treediff crate
 - fall back automatically to this for resources that don't have an annotation
 - don't deploy if the diff contains nothing

 - table otherwise
 - expect only one env by default, all envs with option

** TODO use k8s api instead of relying on kubectl for deployment
** TODO allow complete deployment stop for an env (i.e. disabling a deployer)
 - although that becomes a problem when you have something you really want deployed anyway
 - in that case you could maybe deploy it via command-line
** TODO validate yamls before deploying
 - allow disabling validation by yaml
 - detect k8s version automatically?
 - maybe https://gitlab.com/silwol/juster
** TODO validate & report validation status for envs that aren't actually deployed (i.e. 'latest')
 - handle as 'just validation' Deployer?

* alternatives for version file merge method

version: 123abc
*** base file:

kind: Deployment
...
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      containers:

*** base file does not contain image at all
