* alternatives for version file merge method
** text substitution:
*** version file e.g.:
version: 123abc
*** base file:
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
...
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: service
        image: exampleservice:$version
** json pointer:
*** version file e.g.:
"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/image": "exampleservice:123abc"
*** base file does not contain image at all
** json pointer + container references:
*** version file e.g.:
containers:
  service:
    "/image": "exampleservice:123abc"
