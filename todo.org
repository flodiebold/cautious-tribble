*** deployer
**** when I add a service in dev, the deployer deploys it
**** when I change a service in dev, the deployer updates it
**** when I add/change multiple services at the same time, the deployer updates all of them
**** when K8s is not reachable, the deployer tries again and deploys as soon as it's back again
*** transitioner
**** when I add/change a service in available, the transitioner copies it to dev
**** when I add/change a service in available and dev is locked, the transitioner does not copy it to dev
**** when dev is unlocked, the transitioner mirrors any pending changes from available
*** deployer + transitioner
**** when I change a service in available, it first gets deployed to dev. Then, when the deployment was successful, it gets deployed to pp
**** when a deployment to dev is not successful, it is not mirrored to pp
